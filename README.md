# Complex Root Finder
 
## Polynomial

To set polynomial, go to **POLYNOMIAL** section and set `f` function using `X`. `X` is by default set as complex number.

## Default values

If You  don't want to repeat input everytime, go to section **VARIABLES** and set `USE_DEFAULTS` as `True`. Then You can change values of variables below.
If program doesn't find all roots of the demanded polynomial, try with higher number of `trials`. If it doesn't resolve the problem, change `MIN_VAL` and `MAX_VAL`.
If You don't want to receive convergence info, set `ECHO_CONV` as `False`.
